Data_Science_Project
==============================

This project takes data on product demand for a company with multiple products in different categories (over 2000 products in 33 categories).
This company needs to ship products around the world and so predicting where they need to have certain products and at what time is an
important question to them. 

In my analysis, I try two approaches (both generated by reading around online). One is to set up a decision-tree, which seems to work reasonably well. Unfortunately, I am struggling with the graphics otherwise it seems like there could be some really interesting 
charts for the decision tree. 

The second approach uses an interesting supply management method. This code was provided by the author and he sets parameters around reorders and an idea of the upper limit of the company's inventory. This approach also gives an pretty decent result, and the graphs at the end show clear cyclacality. 

It I were to continue this analysis, I would think of some sort of time-trend analysis with an ARMA or ARIMA model.
